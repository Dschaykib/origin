Title: An R Package that Adds `pkg::` to Functions to be More Explicit
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Matthias Nistler
Maintainer: Matthias Nistler <m_nistler@web.de>
Description: The pure functionality of this package is to add pkg:: to a
    function, i.e. mutate(mtcars, new_var = 1) becomes
    dplyr::mutate(mtcars, new_var = 1). It is up to the user to determine
    which packages should be used explicitly, whether to include base R
    packages or use the functionality on selected text, a file, or a
    complete directory. User friendly logging is provided in the RStudio
    Markers pane. The package lives in the spirit of lintr and styler.
