check_pkg_usage(
  pkgs = getOption("origin.pkgs", .packages()),
  path = getwd(),

  path_to_local_functions = NULL,
  check_local_conflicts = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{a character vector with package names. Defaults to the result of
\link[base]{.packages} but only if the option `origin.pkgs` is not specified.}

\item{path}{a character vector of full path names; the default corresponds 
to the working directory, \link[base]{getwd}()}

\item{recursive}{ogical. Should the listing recurse into directories?}

\item{exclude_files}{a character vector of file paths that should be 
excluded from being checked Helpful if all but a few files should be
considered by origin.}

\item{path_to_local_functions}{file path. Helpful if all project specific
functions are defined in a specific folder. This folder might not be a 
sub directory of the current project so the default to just find all 
function definitions would not be sufficient.}

\item{check_local_conflicts}{if TRUE, it is checked whether locally
defined functions inside of the project mask exported functions
packages listed in pkgs. It avoids mistakenly adding pkg:: to a
custom local function.}

\item{ignore_comments}{if TRUE, commented lines are ignored.}

\item{use_markers}{a boolean. If TRUE, the markers tab inn RStudio is used
to track changes and show issues. FALSE prints the same information in
the console.}
}
\value{
`data.frame` invisibly, It consists of 5 columns. 
- `fun`: all functions in alphabetical order
- `pkg`: the package that exports this function
- `n_calls`: how often the function has been used in the files
- `conflict`: whether this function is exported by multiple checked packages
- `covlict_pkgs`: in case of a conflict, which packages does 
                  export the same function
