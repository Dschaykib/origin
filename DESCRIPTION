Title: An R Package That Adds `pkg::` to Functions to Be More Explicit
Version: 0.4.0
Author: Matthias Nistler
Maintainer: Matthias Nistler <m_nistler@web.de>

BugReports: https://github.com/mnist91/origin/issues
Description: The pure functionality of this package is to add pkg:: 
  to a function, i.e. `mutate(mtcars, new_var = 1)` becomes  `dplyr::mutate(mtcars, new_var = 1)`.
  It is up to the user to determine which packages should be used explicitly, whether
  to include base R packages or use the functionality on selected text, a file, or
  a complete directory. User friendly logging is provided in the "Markers" tab of RStudio.
  The package lives in the spirit of lintr and styler.
