Title: An R Package That Adds `package::` to Functions to Be More Explicit
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Matthias Nistler
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
URL: https://github.com/mnist91/origin
BugReports: https://github.com/mnist91/origin/issues
Description: The pure functionality of this package is to add package:: 
  to function, i.e. `mutate(mtcars, new_var = 1)` becomes  `dplyr::mutate(mtcars, new_var = 1)`.
  It is up to the user to determine which packages should be used explicitly, whether
  to include base R packages or use the functionality on selected text, a file, or
  a complete directory. User friendly logging is provided in the "Markers" tab.
  The package lives in the spirit of lintr and styler.
